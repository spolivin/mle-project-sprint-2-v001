# EDA Results

1. At the beginning of the analysis, an assumption has been made about the impact of the number of rooms on the total area of a flat which could in turn affect its price. Subsequently, via studying the correlation matrices it was found that the number of rooms as well as kitchen/living room areas are pretty much correlated with the total area which is consistent not only with data but also with a common sense. Moreover, number of flats in the building as well as ceiling height have a positive correlation with this variable.

2. After adding the target to the correlation matrix, we have established that both total area and number rooms represent the two factors that affect the flat prices the most. If earlier we have found the significant influence of the rooms number on the total area, then we have additionally verified that the total area of a flat is directly proportional to the number of rooms and the prices is formed based on the total area of the flat. 

3. The factors which one needs to take into account while modeling include: total area, kitchen area, living room area, ceiling height and number of rooms.

4. The presence of very low values in the columns with price and kitchen/living room area which can either be attributed to the system error which assigned the empty values left in the form on the website zeros or to anomalies.
